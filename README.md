About
==============================

This is a React project I made for a Codecademy project. The following were the requirements

It is made of four components to take a search term, location and sort by input from the user; connect with the Yelp API and then present the results back to the user.

The two main things I learned from this project are how to work with an API and how much easier it is to pass data around in a front end with React compared to Django.

I have removed my API key so you will need to registar your own to use this application.
